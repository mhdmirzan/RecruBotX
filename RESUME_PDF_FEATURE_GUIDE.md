## Troubleshooting

### "I see a yellow indicator but I added enough words"

The word counter might not be updating. Try:
1. Click somewhere else in the form to trigger an update

3. Check your text in the field (sometimes extra spaces affect count)

### "Download button is disabled/grayed out"

The button is actively validating your resume. This usually takes 1-2 seconds. If it stays disabled:
1. Scroll through the entire form to ensure all sections are filled
2. Check that all descriptions meet minimum word counts
3. Refresh the page and try again

### "My PDF doesn't print correctly"

When printing:
1. Set margins to "None" or "Minimal"
2. Don't scale or fit to page
3. Use PDF viewer's default print settings
4. Test on a single page first
