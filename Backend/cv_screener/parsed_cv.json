Eager to apply my skills in SQL, Power BI, Python, and data-driven\nproblem solving to contribute to impactful business decisions and continuous improvement in a dynamic\norganization.\nEducation\nUniversity of Engineering and Technology, Taxila | Bachelor’s Degree Taxila,Pakistan | 8.2022 - Current\nCumulative GPA – 3.66\nCurrently pursuing a BSc in Computer Engineering with a focus on core subjects such as Digital Signal\nProcessing, Algorithms, and Database Management Systems. Co-Head of the Machine Learning Team at the\nTaxilians Robotics and Automation Club, where I have gained hands-on experience in machine learning projects.\nWork experience\nOasis Infobyte | Data Scientist Intern Remote, India | 08.2024 – 09.2024\n• Iris Flower Classification: Applied machine learning models like Logistic Regression and KNN to\nclassify iris flower species.\n• Car Price Prediction: Used Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost Regressor to predict\ncar prices, with Linear Regression achieving the best performance.\n• Unemployment Rate Analysis: Analyzed unemployment data to uncover trends and insights, applying\nvarious machine learning models.\nProjects\n• Flask Backend for CRUD Web Application\nBuilt a Flask-based backend for a CRUD application, enabling create, read, update, and delete operations\non user data stored in a MySQL database. Integrated Flask-MySQLdb for secure database interactions and\nimplemented routes for user management with flash messages for feedback. Designed a responsive\nfrontend with HTML and CSS.\n• Sales Performance Dashboard\nDeveloped a Power BI dashboard using the \"Awesome Chocolates\" dataset to analyze sales performance,\ntarget achievements, and salesperson efficiency. Visualized actual vs. target sales, monthly performance\ntrends, and brand-wise contributions. Provided actionable insights to optimize strategies and improve sales\noutcomes.\n• Hospitality Domain Dashboard\nAnalyzed data for Atliq Grands using Power BI, focusing on KPIs like RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy\nrate. The insights revealed revenue trends and booking platform performance. Actionable\nrecommendations were made for improving property performance and managing cancellations.\n• Pizza Sales Analysis\nAnalyzed a pizza sales dataset using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization. Key insights,\nsuch as top-selling pizzas and customer preferences, were uncovered. These findings helped formulate\nactionable recommendations for optimizing inventory and marketing strategies.\n• Data Analytics Challenges\nParticipated in Power BI challenges organized by Onyx Data, Codebasics, and FP20 Analytics, working\non projects like Healthcare Analysis, OTT Merger Analysis, Merchandise Sales Analysis, and Population\nAnalysis. Created interactive dashboards for each project, gaining hands-on experience in data\nvisualization, insights generation, and business reporting using Power BI.\nSkills and Certifications\n• Languages: Python, SQL, MATLAB, C++\n• Tools: Python-Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft\nExcel, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, DAX, MySQL\n• Certifications: Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI, Microsoft PL-300 Exam\nPreparation and Practice, Introduction to Data Engineering by DeepLearning.AI\nMemberships\n• AI Research and Development – Data Science Head\n• Taxilians Robotics and Automation Club – Machine Learning Co head\n• Media Club of University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila – Member\n• Aspire Leaders Alumni\nInterest and Hobbies\n• Reading Books\n• Playing Badminton\n• Teaching Mathematics",
